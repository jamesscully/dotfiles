## Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles I keep here incase I need to move to another Linux installation.

**Warning**: if you're for some reason using these, make sure to remove un-needed folders before copying to your home

Some notable files would be: 



* [Bash config](.bashrc)
* [Vim config](.vimrc)
* [i3 config](.config/i3/config)
